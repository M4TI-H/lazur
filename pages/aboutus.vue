        <p class="text-sm text-light">
          Our vision is to shape a new language of contemporary style — one that
          celebrates individuality, responsibility, and longevity. We envision a
          world where fashion is not disposable, but deeply personal; where each
          garment carries a sense of intention and calm.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-light">
          Lazur stands for a minimalist future, where less becomes more — where
          design serves not to overwhelm, but to empower. We strive to connect
          creativity with consciousness, merging innovation with ethical
          craftsmanship. Through deliberate design and honest materials, we aim
          to inspire confidence that doesn't fade — confidence that evolves with
          you.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-light">
          Lazur isn't just about the clothes that you wear. It's about how you
          live - with purpose, with awareness, and with effortless style.
